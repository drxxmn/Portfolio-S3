### 1. Web application
#### Front-end project
For my front-end I have used [React native](https://reactnative.dev), [Expo](https://expo.dev), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/).

I have chosen [React native](https://reactnative.dev) because it's the industry standard, and I would like to familiarize myself with the workflow so I can apply it in the future in jobs. It also has a lot of resources and tutorials online I can follow. Using [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/). I can quickly setup tabs and create a simple front-end for my messaging application.

#### Back-end project
For my back-end I used [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) and [GraphQL](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli-legacy/graphql-transformer/overview/)
