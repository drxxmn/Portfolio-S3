## *‘Surveillance is the business model of the internet’*
### *Intro*
In the era of the internet, consumers seem to be increasingly more willing to resign certain aspects of their privacy for more convenience in using their technology, and have more or less accepted that being monitored by multi-million dollar corporations and even governments is just a fact of modern life.

This subject is unimaginably wide and diverse and is hard to cover, thus in this research I'll be focusing on a specific social media platform/ messaging app called [Discord](https://Discord.gg).

### *What is Discord?*
Discord is a free to use communication app, and in just six years Discord went from being a new startup to being forth over seven billion dollars. That makes Discord worth more than Skype, Pinterest, Tumblr and so many more. 

Unlike other social media giants Discord doesn't even have ads, and it's free to use, yet it is one of the highest valued social media companies in the world, Microsoft even attempted to buy Discord for 12 billion dollars. Nonetheless, even such a big number was turned down by the founders of Discord because they knew and understood that Discord will be worth much more in the future.

### *But how is this possible?*
On the surface, Discord only makes this money
through a subscription model: "Discord Nitro"
initially, "Discord Nitro" could be
purchased for $4.99 a month and gave its
subscribers access to various
customizations and upgrades such as global emotes, stickers and higher quality video sharing. Later on Discord added
new features like server boosting and
larger file uploads. That's all well
and good until you do the math. In July
of 2020 Discord purportedly generated
120 million dollars from subscriptions.

But then how is Discord a multi-billion
dollar company if it's only generating
120 million dollars from subscriptions? 
The company hasn't any profit since its founding, so are
subscriptions really the key behind
Discord's billion dollar worth?

### *What is Tencent?*
In January 2021 Tencent was 
valued at almost 1 trillion dollars. They
are modern day titan, and Tencent like any
other large company in China is
effectively a commercial branch of the
CCP.

But how did they come to hold such a
position of power over the world's
economy?
In the past they were a government
mobile provider, but they quickly expanded
into video games and direct messaging
and in recent years they're taking over
the world owning majority equity in [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/en) (a large video game company), investing in [Reddit](https://reddit.com) and founding
one of the biggest social networks
[WeChat,](https://www.wechat.com) which has over 1 billion users
worldwide 

to expand China's influence, Tencent has
been buying up stakes in some of
America's biggest tech giants. Most
notably buying a 38% share in Discord
which is very problematic when you take
a look at recent Chinese politics like
*the CCP's new national intelligence law:*
a law that makes all citizens and
companies legally obliged to help the
government gather foreign intelligence
intelligence on the data of billions of people
around the world or while keeping any
corporation with the government, a secret.
So when you understand that Tencent
is just a subsidiary of the Chinese
government, it's not hard to imagine why
Tencent has suddenly bought shares in
over 600 companies at exactly the same
time that the Chinese law required its
companies to share user data with
Beijing and all while this was happening
In China, Discord was just starting to blow
up, that's why Tencent was so quick to
buy up 38% of Discord.

### *Permanent data* 
it might not be a coincidence that
Discord just so happens to be very bad with your
personal info. Right now when you feel like you don't want to use Discord's services anymore you might decide to delete your account.
But when you try to delete the app, you'll realize that your account was never truly deleted, it just gave you the illusion and idea that it was deleted.
After two weeks you have the choice to permanently ban your Discord account or to recover it, and it might seem like all your data is deleted, but that's not the case with Discord. 

Instead, Discord stores all your data within their servers, even after you've deleted your account. But when you understand that one of Discord's major shareholder is Tencent (who must by law send all data back to the Chinese government). This fact will raise some scary questions considering how much data Discord is collecting as it gets bigger and bigger every year and so does its control because Discord tracks every click, every message, every word you type, your name, age, gender, location, applications you use and every server you're in.

### *End-to-end encryption*
According to the [Mozilla Foundation,](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/Discord/) Discord doesn't have
end-to-end encryption like other
messenger apps such as WhatsApp or
Facebook, so then Discord's not
only storing data on everything you type,
every game you play and everything you do, but Discord is now also
vulnerable to hackers stealing this data
because of its weak encryption. Just one security
breach and hundreds of millions of people's
personal information is now public to
the world.

### *What can we do to keep our data safe?*
If you use Discord, it may be best to always keep in mind that every message you send and everything you do on it is tracked. Make sure you never overshare on social media and use apps that have end-to-end encryption.
Find apps that are more focused on the consumer's privacy and convince your friends and family to use it, for example an app like [Signal](https://signal.org/nl/).
