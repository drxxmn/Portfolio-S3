## **Getting started**

### *What defines a messaging app?*
A messaging app is a chat application or platform that enables users to instant message and connect with each other through their computers or mobile devices. Think Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, or Slack (just to name a few). 

### *The benefits of using existing apps*
There are many benefits to use already existing messaging applications. 

Existing messaging applictations already have all the ground work laid out for you, it is very simple and easy to just install and use. You can already send out messages, video's images etc. with just a simple sign up and installation you can get whatsapp, facebook, snapchat etc. and message your friends.
It is also more familiar to most people, so it would be easy for them to install, add you and navigate the different menus, so then why would we want to use and create our own messaging app? 

### *The benefits of making your own app*
One of the more technical reasons is so that we can learn and create our own application, put it on our portfolio, find out how a messaging exactly works and how difficult it is to make it on your own. But there are a lot more benefits if you want to make one for your friends, family or community.

A more fun reasons to make your own application is the customization, you can create your own themes, sounds, features etc. Often times when you use other messaging applications you miss certain features, or wish some things were done in certain ways. By making your own application you can add anything you want and make it look exactly the way you desire.

One of the more important issues with messaging apps is [security](#messaging-and-security), the risks involved and who you want to give your data to. I go more in depth on this topic [here](#messaging-and-security)
